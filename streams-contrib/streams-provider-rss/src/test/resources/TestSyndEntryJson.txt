With that issue in mind, FeedHenry created a namesake BaaS platform that took advantage of <a href=\"http://nodejs.org/\">Node.js</a> to create a BaaS platform that developers could deploy and ultimately move to any cloud platform of their choice.","type":"text/html"},"link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ProgrammableWeb/~3/qHpel755J7w/","modules":["http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"],"publishedDate":"2014-05-02T11:07:06.000-05:00","title":"FeedHenry Extends Reach of BaaS Platform","uri":"http://blog.programmableweb.com/?p=83638"}

Now what? How do you get the word out? First, throw everything you know about marketing out the window. Indeed, the old style of marketing doesn’t apply when it comes to APIs. The notion of building a marketing campaign replete with ads and PR fluff is virtually non-existent in the world of API marketing. Why? When you create an API, you are creating a community. This community of users will drive your marketing in a highly decentralized way.","type":"text/html"},"link":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ProgrammableWeb/~3/O2Ol3kBFpqk/","modules":["http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"],"publishedDate":"2014-04-28T15:00:07.000-05:00","title":"10 Ways To Market Your API (And Why Old-School Marketing Won’t Work)","uri":"http://blog.programmableweb.com/?p=83440"}
